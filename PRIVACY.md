# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: December 17, 2025_

## Introduction
LinkedIn Wrap Bot is a browser extension that helps users generate insights and summaries from their own LinkedIn analytics. We are committed to protecting your privacy and minimizing data usage.

## Data We Access
The extension only reads data that is already visible to you on LinkedIn analytics pages, such as:
- Content impressions
- Members reached
- Likes and comment counts

## What We Do NOT Collect
We do **not** collect, store, or access:
- LinkedIn usernames or passwords
- Private messages or inbox data
- Connections or contact lists
- Payment or financial information
- Precise location data
- Device fingerprints or tracking identifiers

## How Data Is Used
All accessed data is used solely to:
- Generate analytics summaries
- Create visual reports (e.g., “LinkedIn Wrapped” style insights)
- Display statistics within the extension UI

The data is processed only for your personal use.

## Data Storage
- Data is processed locally within your browser.
- Any saved data is stored using browser-local storage mechanisms.
- No analytics data is sent to external servers.
- We do not sell, rent, or share user data.

## Data Sharing
We do not share any collected data with third parties.

Communication occurs only between extension components (content scripts, background scripts, popup) using standard browser extension messaging.

## Permissions
The extension may request:
- **Active Tab / Scripting** – to read analytics data from the LinkedIn page you are viewing
- **Storage** – to save reports or preferences locally

These permissions are used strictly for core functionality.

## User Control
You remain in full control:
- The extension only runs when enabled
- Data is accessed only on pages you can visit
- You can clear stored data via browser settings
- Uninstalling the extension removes all stored data

## LinkedIn Disclaimer & User Responsibility
LinkedIn Wrap Bot is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by LinkedIn. Use of LinkedIn remains subject to LinkedIn’s own Terms and Privacy Policy.

**Use at your own risk.** Automated scraping of LinkedIn data may be a violation of LinkedIn's User Agreement. You are solely responsible for any consequences resulting from the use of this extension, including but not limited to account restrictions, suspensions, or other actions taken by LinkedIn.

## Policy Updates
This Privacy Policy may be updated as features evolve. Any changes will be reflected in this file with an updated revision date.
